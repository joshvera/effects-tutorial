decomp :: Union (t:r) v -> Either (Union r v) (t v)

The type of inj/prj really shows the union as a (multi)set.

decomp imposes the ordering. Dissatisfaction. What we really need
is something like the local instances with the closure seamntics.
And Haskell almost has what we need! (Implicit parameters).
